    <summary>Detect It Easy, or abbreviated DIE is a program for determining types of files.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[DIE is a cross-platform application, apart from Windows version there are also
available versions for Linux and Mac OS.

Many programs of the kind (PEID, PE tools) allow to use third-party signatures.
Unfortunately, those signatures scan only bytes by the pre-set mask, and it is
not possible to specify additional parameters. As the result, false triggering
often occur. More complicated algorithms are usually strictly set in the program
itself. Hence, to add a new complex detect one needs to recompile the entire
project. No one, except the authors themselves, can change the algorithm of
a detect. As time passes, such programs lose relevance without the constant support.

Detect It Easy has totally open architecture of signatures. You can easily
add your own algorithms of detects or modify those that already exist. This
is achieved by using scripts. The script language is very similar to JavaScript
and any person, who understands the basics of programming, will understand easily
how it works. Possibly, someone may decide the scripts are working very slow.
Indeed, scripts run slower than compiled code, but, thanks to the good optimization
of Script Engine, this doesn't cause any special inconvenience. The possibilities
of open architecture compensate these limitations.

DIE exists in three versions. Basic version (DIE), Lite version (DIEL) and
console version (DIEC). All the three use the same signatures, which are located
in the folder db. If you open this folder, nested sub-folders will be found
(Binary, PE and others). The names of sub-folders correspond to the types of files.
First, DIE determines the type of file, and then sequentially loads all the signatures,
which lie in the corresponding folder. Currently the program defines the following types:

* MSDOS executable files MS-DOS

* PE executable files Windows

* ELF executable files Linux

* MACH executable files Mac OS

* Text files

* Binary all other files
