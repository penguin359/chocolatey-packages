Of course you can also manually disable all the options and then activate again, but with Don't Sleep one can save now many hand moves and also save time! And it's easier than ever. 

Apart from the fact Don't Sleep has a timer that allows time control unblock, or shutdown the computer for a specified time.

**For what! Prevent system shutdown, Standby, Hibernate, Turn Off and Restart?**
 
The reason for the development of the program is that some programs with a longer runtime have not considered this new power-saving features on the windows OS. 

You can also manually customize the window **power saving features** or disable all the options and then reactivate them again, but you can save the time when use  Don't Sleep. Don't Sleep can also serve as a general protection if you have started a background service or application and want to prevent turn off of the computer by itself, or other persons ergo accounts. 

Don't Sleep has a timer that allows you to disable blocking with a timed manner, or to shut down the computer at a certain time. This is a practical function that prevents the PC to running unnecessarily, since not every PC is equipped with a quality power supply that consumes 1Watt in standby mode.

### How does the program work? 

Depending on the setting, Don't Sleep reports to the operating system that it has very important tasks to do if the screen saver is to be activated or the monitor is to be deactivated. Likewise, it notifies the system that it has the highest shutdown priority to prevent other programs from receiving the shutdown command before Don't
