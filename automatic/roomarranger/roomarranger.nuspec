## Reasons to Choose Room Arranger

### Easy to Use

heart Nearly all functions have keyboard shortcuts, so you can learn to be pretty fast in Room Arranger.

Our motto: Keep It Simple, Stupid...

### 3D Visualization
3D can give you a better impression of your design. Room Arranger will not only let you fly around the scene, but you can also walk through it like in reality.
BTW, did you know you can have multiple floors in the single project?

And you can make movies here too.

### Build on Floor Plan Image
floorplan Drawing walls can be quite time consuming for apartment or house design. So there is a way to make it easier in case you have an image or photo of the floor plan.
Just load the image of the floor plan into the Wall Editor, calibrate it, and draw walls on top of it. Read more...

### Wide Object Library
sofa There are nearly 300 objects in the standard object library. Furniture, and other equipment. For each of them, you can modify their dimensions exactly as you need - you are not limited to what we think is the most common.
Additionally you can quickly and easily design all your special objects directly in Room Arranger, there is a set of 3D objects just for such needs. Some users contributed to our On-line object library and shared their work.

### Measurement
There is a measurement tool in Room Arranger that helps you to check if there is enough space left for other objects, or just visualize the dimensions in the project.
The software also measures the room areas, wall areas and other useful values. It will let you copy - paste them to Excel for further processing.

### Print in Scale
Printing is the integral part of designer's work. We try to make this output precisely and in high quality. Professional architects usually require printouts in exact 1:50 or 1:100 scale, which is possible in Room Arranger.
print In case you have only small A4 printer, the software manages to print the project over more pages. You will just glue all sheets of paper together.

### Multilingual

The translations are provided by native speaking fans. Thanks to them.
