    <description><![CDATA[## What is SALOME
SALOME is an open-source software that provides a generic Pre- and Post-Processing platform for numerical simulation. It is based on an open and flexible architecture made of reusable components.

SALOME is a cross-platform solution. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU LGPL license. You can download both the source code and the executables from this site.

## How can SALOME be used?
SALOME can be used as a standalone application for generation of the CAD model, its preparation for the numerical calculations and post-processing of the calculation results.

SALOME can also be used as a platform for integration of the external third-party numerical codes to produce a new application for the full life-cycle management of CAD models.

## SALOME core features
- Supports interoperability between CAD modeling and computation software (CAD-CAE link).
- Facilitates integration of new components into heterogeneous systems for the numerical computation.
- Sets priority to the multi-physics coupling between computation softwares.
- Provides generic, user-friendly and efficient, user interface, which helps to reduce the costs and delays of carrying out the studies.
- Reduces training time to the specific time for learning the software solution based on this platform.
- Provides access to all functionalities via the integrated Python console.

## What can you do with SALOME?
- Create, modify, import and export (IGES, STEP, BREP, ...), repair and clean CAD models.
- Generate mesh for CAD models; edit meshes; check mesh quality; import and export mesh data (MED, UNV, DAT, STL, ...).
- Handle physical properties and quantities attached to geometrical items.
- Perform computation using one or more external solvers (coupling).
- Display computation results (scalar, vectorial data).
- Manage studies (create, save, reload, ...).
