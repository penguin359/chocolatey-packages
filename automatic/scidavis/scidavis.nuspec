    <description><![CDATA[## Features

This is a brief summary of what SciDAVis can do. If you are still unsure whether it meets your needs, you can also take a look at the screenshots or simply download SciDAVis and see for yourself!

- Tables (2D data), matrices (3D data), graphs (2D or 3D plots) and notes (text notes or scripts) are gathered in a Project and can be organized using folders.
- Data for tables or matrices can be entered directly or imported from ASCII files.
- Cell values in tables can be computed using standard and special functions (and much more if you have Python installed). Each table cell can be assigned an individual formula.
- Multi-level undo/redo for tables and matrices.
- Many built-in analysis operations like column/row statistics, (de)convolution, FFT and FFT-based filters.
- Extensive support for fitting linear and nonlinear functions to the data, including multi-peak fitting.
- Publication-quality 2D plots of various types including symbols/lines, bars and pie charts which can be exported to a variety of formats (JPG, PNG, EPS, PDF, SVG and more).
- Interactive 3D plots with export to a variety of formats, including EPS and PDF.
- Note windows with support for in-place evaluation of mathematical expressions. With Python installed, you can even access other objects in the project, e.g. for rapidly writing an import filter for a custom data format.
