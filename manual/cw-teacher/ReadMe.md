CW Teacher will teach you Morse Code at your own pace. Set the sending rate at 18 WPM or higher so that you learn the characters at a functional speed, but don't worry, the software will send you each character, one at a time and wait for you to respond. There is zero rush. The entire emphasis of the software is teaching you to associate a sound with a letter. With just a bit of practice, that's really easy to do!

Since copying CW with a keyboard is exactly what you will be doing when you are CW contesting, this software helps you become comfortable transferring what you hear to your keyboard directly as well.

The emphasis of this software is teaching Morse code from the absolute beginning, but I've also included options for more advanced practice, such as copying random call signs and Field Day style exchanges.

This program is completely free! Please enjoy it and share it with anyone you may know who would like to learn CW!
