    <summary>Client for Winlink Global Radio Email</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[Winlink Express
===============

Winlink Express (formerly RMS Express) is the preferred Winlink radio email client because it supports all new system features, and it is the only client supporting the [Winlink Hybrid Network](https://www.winlink.org/HybridNetwork) for email delivery with or without the internet. Winlink Express is designed to be easily used by single users with a single call sign but it may also be used to simultaneously send and receive mail with one or two more tactical addresses or alternate Winlink accounts. It supports a wide selection of transceivers, TNCs and multimode controllers, sound card modes using the ARDOP, and VARA HF and FM virtual TNCs (ARDOP software TNC included), Pactor, SCS Robust Packet, VHF/UHF AX.25 packet radio, and direct telnet to CMS servers or RMS Relay (for amateur radio High Speed Multimedia [HSMM], Broadband HamNet, D-Star DD mode, internet, and any other TCP/IP network).

Winlink Express is built by the Winlink Development Team and leverages its features with simplicity as the prime design objective. It uses the open [B2F](https://www.winlink.org/B2F) extension radio transfer protocol that supports attachments, multiple addresses and tactical addresses. Winlink Express may be used in the peer-to-peer mode (connecting directly via RF to other Winlink Express or Airmail clients). Winlink Express also contains manual and automated GPS position reporting abilities, support for the Winlink catalog of downloadable weather, information and help bulletins, Saildocs and Globalmarinenet for obtaining GRIB files, and a propagation prediction feature to help determine which of the participating Winlink RMS gateway HF stations are best to connect to from anywhere on earth.

Winlink Express may be used as a client for emergency communications. It has special features for EmComm, such as HTML forms creation and compact, formless content transport, plus [a growing library of automatically-updated, included forms](https://www.winlink.org/RMSExpressForms) to use. Before adopting Winlink Express as your program for EmComm, please check with your local EmComm group for their plans. This may be your ARES, RACES, ACS, AuxComm, SHARES or MARS organization that will be responsible for providing training and support.

**System Requirements:** Microsoft-supported 32 or 64 bit Windows OS (Windows Vista, Windows 7, 8, 10 or Windows 2003 Server, or later, or under Windows on Apple Mac and Linux machines using a VM engine or dual boot arrangement. Windows XP or earlier OS are not supported. The program makes minimal CPU demands except in modes using sound card modems. The heavy DSP demands of these modes require a computer of at least 700 MHz Pentium/Celeron class and at least 512 Meg of memory. It runs well on all modern computers and Windows tablets. If multiple applications are running concurrently, we recommend a fast, late-model computer with 2-4MB RAM or more.

Winlink Express Includes:
-------------------------

**Built-in Customizable HTML Forms** allow input and reading on exact-likeness or just "pretty" forms in a browser using form widgets like selection boxes, check boxes, and more. Further, lightweight form contents can be transmitted without the form itself, then automatically read at the other end inside the electronic form with a browser. A large, automatically-updated common library of forms is included with each copy of Winlink Express. And, the forms and templates are transportable across a radio connection as attachments.

**Built-in Message Log Report Generator** creates automatic reports from your local Winlink Express message records. Generates ICS-309 reports for ICS compliance and comma-separated text files. Lets you choose what logs to include in the report (Inbox, Read items, Outbox, Sent items, Saved items, Drafts, Deleted items).]]></description>
