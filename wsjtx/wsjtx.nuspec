    <summary>WSJT-X is an open-source programs designed for weak-signal digital communication by amateur radio.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[WSJT-X implements communication protocols or "modes" called FST4, FST4W, FT4, FT8, JT4, JT9, JT65, Q65, MSK144, and WSPR, as well as one called Echo for detecting and measuring your own radio signals reflected from the Moon.  These modes were designed for making reliable, confirmed QSOs under extreme weak-signal conditions. 

JT4, JT9, and JT65 use nearly identical message structure and source encoding (the efficient compression of standard messages used for minimal QSOs). They use timed 60-second T/R sequences synchronized with UTC.  JT4 and JT65 were designed for EME ("moonbounce") on the VHF/UHF/microwave bands.  JT9 is optimized for the MF and HF bands.  It  is about 2 dB more sensitive than JT65 while using less than 10% of the bandwidth.  Q65 offers submodes with a wide range of T/R sequence lengths and tone spacings; it is highly recommended for EME, ionospheric scatter, and other weak signal work on VHF, UHF, and microwave bands.

FT4 and FT8 are operationally similar but use T/R cycles only 7.5 and  15 s long, respectively.  MSK144 is designed for Meteor Scatter on the VHF bands.  These modes offer enhanced message formats with support for nonstandard callsigns and some popular contests.

FST4 and FST4W are designed particularly for the LF and MF bands. On these bands their fundamental sensitivities are better than other WSJT-X modes with the same sequence lengths, approaching the theoretical limits for their rates of information throughput. FST4 is optimized for two-way QSOs, while FST4W is for quasi-beacon transmissions of WSPR-style messages. FST4 and FST4W do not require the strict, independent time synchronization and phase locking of modes like EbNaut.

WSPR mode implements a protocol designed for probing potential propagation paths with low-power transmissions.  WSPR is fully implemented within WSJT-X, including programmable "band-hopping".]]></description>
    <releaseNotes><![CDATA[WSJT-X 2.6.0 is a General Availability (GA) release, the first since
version 2.5.4.  Its major enhancements include the following:

 - Mode selection buttons on main window for FT4, FT8, JT65, MSK144, 
   Q65, and FT8's Hound mode 
 - Support for the ARRL International Digital Contest
 - Performance enhancements for the FT8 and Q65 modes
 - New features for EME Echo mode, including calibrated SNR reports
 - Several new convenience features for Fox operators 
 - Save/Restore capability, "Preferred" status, and effective date
   ranges for mode-dependent tables of default frequencies
 - Improved display features for contest log
 - Improved calibration of SNR estimates for modes FST4 and FST4W

Other enhancements and bug fixes since 2.6.0-rc5 include the following:

 - PSK Reporter spotting is now also possible for frequencies > 4 GHz. 
   This is required for QO-100, for example.

 - The minimum width of the main window has been further reduced, and 
   such small sizes are now remembered and properly restored.

 - Some further improvements for Fox operators.

 - Fix the long-standing flaw that "Start new period decodes at top" 
   didn't work anymore after several hours.

 - Fix a flaw that could cause crashes by double-clicking messages 
   with <...> in certain QSO situations.

 - Fix a flaw that prevented the rig from initializing correctly after 
   switching between configurations when connected via HRD.

 - Add tooltips to better explain the split operation options.

 - Add some additional FT roundup exchanges which can be used for 
   local contests or QSO parties.

 - Add an option to call CQ with an individual contest name.

 - Update of some ARRL section abbreviations.
