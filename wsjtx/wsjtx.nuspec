    <summary>WSJT-X is an open-source programs designed for weak-signal digital communication by amateur radio.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[[WSJT-X](https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx.html) ("Weak Signal Communication, by K1JT") offers specific digital protocols optimized for EME (moonbounce), meteor scatter, and ionospheric scatter, at VHF/UHF, as well as for LF, MF, and HF propagation.  The program can decode fraction-of-a-second signals reflected from ionized meteor trails and steady signals more than 10 dB below the audible threshold.  WSJT-X incorporates nearly all popular capabilities of programs WSJT and WSPR, while adding comprehensive rig control and many other features.  Check the [WSJT-X](https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx.html) page and links therein for details about modes FT4, FT8, FST4, FST4S, JT4, JT9, JT65, Q65, MSK144, and WSPR.

WSJT-X implements communication protocols or "modes" called **FST4**, **FST4W**, **FT4**, **FT8**, **JT4**, **JT9**, **JT65**, **Q65**, **MSK144**, and **WSPR**, as well as one called Echo for detecting and measuring your own radio signals reflected from the Moon.  These modes were designed for making reliable, confirmed QSOs under extreme weak-signal conditions.

**JT4**, **JT9**, and **JT65** use nearly identical message structure and source encoding (the efficient compression of standard messages used for minimal QSOs). They use timed 60-second T/R sequences synchronized with UTC.  **JT4** and **JT65** were designed for EME ("moonbounce") on the VHF/UHF/microwave bands.  **JT9** is optimized for the MF and HF bands.  It  is about 2 dB more sensitive than **JT65** while using less than 10% of the bandwidth.  **Q65** offers submodes with a wide range of T/R sequence lengths and tone spacings; it is highly recommended for EME, ionospheric scatter, and other weak signal work on VHF, UHF, and microwave bands.

**FT4** and **FT8** are operationally similar but use T/R cycles only 7.5 and  15 s long, respectively.  **MSK144** is designed for Meteor Scatter on the VHF bands.  These modes offer enhanced message formats with support for nonstandard callsigns and some popular contests.

**FST4** and **FST4W** are designed particularly for the LF and MF bands. On these bands their fundamental sensitivities are better than other WSJT-X modes with the same sequence lengths, approaching the theoretical limits for their rates of information throughput. **FST4** is optimized for two-way QSOs, while **FST4W** is for quasi-beacon transmissions of **WSPR**-style messages. **FST4** and **FST4W** do not require the strict, independent time synchronization and phase locking of modes like EbNaut.

As described more fully on [its own page](https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wspr.html), **WSPR** mode implements a protocol designed for probing potential propagation paths with low-power transmissions.  **WSPR** is fully implemented within WSJT-X, including programmable "band-hopping".]]></description>
